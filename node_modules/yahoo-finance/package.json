  "readme": "## PLEASE READ: This library is partially broken due to sudden API change by Yahoo Finance. The fantastic [@gadicc](https://github.com/gadicc) is currently working on a fix to support the new API. Please follow [PR #42](https://github.com/pilwon/node-yahoo-finance/pull/42) for the progress.\n\n# yahoo-finance\n\n`yahoo-finance` is [Yahoo Finance](http://finance.yahoo.com/) historical quotes and snapshot data downloader written in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).\n\nThe library handles fetching, parsing, and cleaning of CSV data and returns JSON result that is convenient and easy to work with. Both callback (last parameter) and promises (using [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird)) styles are supported.\n\nAlso check out [google-finance](https://github.com/pilwon/node-google-finance).\n\n\n## Important: New Yahoo API\n\nYahoo completely replaced their API on 2017-05-16.  This interim release is intended to get you up and running again quickly, but we're still working on it.  Note also that Yahoo stopped supporting their API for developers some time ago, so no guarantees can be made about service availability, but probably this package will keep working thanks to the magic of open-source.  Regarding the package API:\n\n* `historical()` - should work as expected - please check the output and report any inconsistencies.\n\n* `snapshot()` - deprecated - returns the original format for SOME old options via a mapping layer.  Since Yahoo's new API does not contain all the same data as the old version, 100% compatibility is impossible - but for the most common options, this should ease upgrade pains.  When you can, transition to the new `quote()` API instead.\n\n* `quote()` - NEW API more faithful to Yahoo's new API.  See below.  This replaces `snapshot()` and we suggest you use it instead.\n\n\n## Installation\n\n    $ npm install --save yahoo-finance\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar yahooFinance = require('yahoo-finance');\n\nyahooFinance.historical({\n  symbol: 'AAPL',\n  from: '2012-01-01',\n  to: '2012-12-31',\n  // period: 'd'  // 'd' (daily), 'w' (weekly), 'm' (monthly), 'v' (dividends only)\n}, function (err, quotes) {\n  //...\n});\n\n// This replaces the deprecated snapshot() API\nyahooFinance.quote({\n  symbol: 'AAPL',\n  modules: [ 'price', 'summaryDetail' ] // see the docs for the full list\n}, function (err, quotes) {\n  // ...\n});\n\n```\n\n* [See more comprehensive examples here.](https://github.com/pilwon/node-yahoo-finance/tree/master/examples)\n\n* See the [full quote() docs](docs/quote.md) for the list of all possible\nmodules and the data they return.\n\n* See also the [deprecated snapshot() API](docs/snapshot.md) docs, for\nreference.\n\n## API\n\n### Download Historical Data (single symbol)\n\n```js\nyahooFinance.historical({\n  symbol: SYMBOL,\n  from: START_DATE,\n  to: END_DATE\n}, function (err, quotes) {\n  /*\n  [\n    {\n      date: Thu Nov 07 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (EST),\n      open: 45.1,\n      high: 50.09,\n      low: 44,\n      close: 44.9,\n      volume: 117701700,\n      adjClose: 44.9,\n      symbol: 'TWTR'\n    },\n    ...\n    {\n      date: Thu Nov 14 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (EST),\n      open: 42.34,\n      high: 45.67,\n      low: 42.24,\n      close: 44.69,\n      volume: 11090800,\n      adjClose: 44.69,\n      symbol: 'TWTR'\n    }\n  ]\n  */\n});\n```\n\n### Download Historical Data (multiple symbols)\n\n```js\nyahooFinance.historical({\n  symbols: [SYMBOL1, SYMBOL2],\n  from: START_DATE,\n  to: END_DATE\n}, function (err, result) {\n  /*\n  {\n    YHOO: [\n      {\n        date: Fri Apr 12 1996 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT),\n        open: 25.25,\n        high: 43,\n        low: 24.5,\n        close: 33,\n        volume: 408720000,\n        adjClose: 1.38,\n        symbol: 'YHOO'\n      },\n      ...\n      {\n        date: Thu Nov 14 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (EST),\n        open: 35.07,\n        high: 35.89,\n        low: 34.76,\n        close: 35.69,\n        volume: 21368600,\n        adjClose: 35.69,\n        symbol: 'YHOO'\n      }\n    ],\n    GOOGL: [\n      {\n        date: Thu Aug 19 2004 00:00:00 GMT-0400 (EDT),\n        open: 100,\n        high: 104.06,\n        low: 95.96,\n        close: 100.34,\n        volume: 22351900,\n        adjClose: 100.34,\n        symbol: 'GOOGL'\n      },\n      ...\n      {\n        date: Thu Nov 14 2013 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (EST),\n        open: 1033.92,\n        high: 1039.75,\n        low: 1030.35,\n        close: 1035.23,\n        volume: 1166700,\n        adjClose: 1035.23,\n        symbol: 'GOOGL'\n      }\n    ],\n    ...\n  }\n  */\n});\n```\n\n### Specifying request options\n\nOptionally request options (such as a proxy) can be specified by inserting an\nextra parameter just before the callback:\n\n\n```js\nvar httpRequestOptions = {\n  proxy: 'http://localproxy.com'\n};\n\n\nyahooFinance.historical({\n  symbol: SYMBOL,\n  from: START_DATE,\n  to: END_DATE\n}, httpRequestOptions, function (err, quotes) {\n  // Result\n});\n\n\nyahooFinance.quote({\n  symbol: SYMBOL,\n  modules: MODULES  // ex: ['price', 'summaryDetail']\n}, httpRequestOptions, function (err, snapshot) {\n  // Result\n});\n```\n\n## Credits\n\n  See the [contributors](https://github.com/pilwon/node-yahoo-finance/graphs/contributors).\n\n* Special thanks to [@gadicc](https://github.com/gadicc) who brought the broken library back to life when Yahoo suddently changed their API.
